### About me

I'm Nebula, a developer from the United States. I started projects such as [palera1n](https://github.com/palera1n/palera1n) and [Permasigner](https://github.com/permasigner/permasigner). My favorite programming languages are Python, Typescript, and Rust, and I'm trying to get better at all 3 while learning a little C too.

If you need to contact me, you can do so at `me@itsnebula.net`. If this is some sort of security issue or private information, please encrypt your email with [my GPG key](https://static.itsnebula.net/gpgkey.asc) (`FB04F6C8EC56DA32F33008C53D1B28A5FACCB53B`).

If you want to know more about the languages and tools I use, please look at my [website](https://itsnebula.net)!

If you'd like to support me, you can buy my iOS tweak, [Ding](https://chariz.com/buy/ding) :3
